    <p>Hi! My name is Michael Czigler and I create minimally viable solutions written in C.</p>
    <h2>Project Examples</h2>
    <p>These are a few of my favorite things...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>xwm, a tiny XCB floating window manager<br>https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm</li>
      <li>xbg, a tiny XCB root window color setter<br>https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg</li>
      <li>kirc, a tiny IRC clinet written in POSIX C99<br>https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc</li>
      <li>kfc, a color palette setter written in POSIX C99<br>https://github.com/mcpcpc/kfc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 32 year engineer with 10yrs+ experience developing phased arrays and MRI surface coil technology. My side pashion is all things Unix. I am an American currently live in the glorious state of Ohio, home of the Indians and (dare i say it) Browns.</p>
    <p>You might be asking, why is this website so ugly? Where is the color and why only plain text? This pays homage to the Unix and KISS philosophies that less is more. Simple can be beautiful and yet entirely functional.</p>
    <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
    <p>If you would like to sponsor me or support any of the work have done, I do accept beer money via paypal: https://www.paypal.me/mcpcpc/usd5</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions or issues with any of the aforementioned projects, please contact me at info[at]mcpcpc[dot]com or reach out to me on the #kirc or #kisslinux IRC server channels.</p>
