A Mini Recipe to Linux Theming
==============================

Tips and tricks for aspiring linux ricers and theming.

The creative process of theming (or "ricing") is something that has always 
fascinated me. Like many software developers and UNIX enthusiasts, I find myself
frequently perusing sub-reddits and, on occasion, posting my unique Linux 
creations on */r/unixporn* [0]. I don't necessarily consider myself a "ricer", I
have developed a recipe that works and thought was worth sharing. 

*   **Get inspired**. For me, it always starts with a quote or wallpaper that I    
    like, and I build around it. 
*   **Build A Color Schema**. I haven't found a good methodology for this one 
    (kudos to those that can do this from scratch) and usually resort to cycling
    through pre-configured palettes (a.k.a. spamming `kfc -rp` in a VTE, which 
    applies a new random color scheme). If I am lucky, I can usually find one
    that meshes well enough.  
*   **Express yourself**. Showcase the tools that you use on a daily basis or,
    better yet, the tools you working on! Avoid the stereotypical tools (e.g 
    neofetch, top, mpv, firefox, etc).

The rest is personal preference, but I would recommend keeping it simple.  I try
to keep my entire theming process to ~30min or so as this can be a dangerous
time sink and there comes a point of diminishing return.
