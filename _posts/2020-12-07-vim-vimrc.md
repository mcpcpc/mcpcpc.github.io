title: Minimum vim Configuration
description: A developer's minimal .vimrc configuration.
---

As a person that uses vim on a daily basis, I find it nearly I
impossible to use without some additional configuration (kudos to those
that can). However, I do feel that most vim configuration files are
overly complex and completely defeat the purpose of using a minimalistic
text editor like vim in the first place. It's taken me almost a year,
but I think I have refined my config file to the absolute minimum number
of custom settings that I require on a daily basis. Below, I have
provided my raw ~/.vimrc configuration file, along with an explanation
on specific settings that new vim users might find confusing:

## The breakdown

The above configuration file is nice and short, but what does each
parameter exactly do?


|abbreviation                |parameter    |description               |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
|`nocp`|`nocompatible`|This changes the values of a LOT of options, enabling features which are not Vi compatible but really really nice.|
|`ai`|`autoindent`|Automatic indentation.|
|`hls`|`hlsearch`|With the defaults, setting this option causes all text matching the current search to be highlighted using the Search highlight group, which adds a yellow background to the current highlighting.|
|`ru`|`ruler`|Shows the "ruler" for the cursor (i.e. its current position with line+column and the percentage within the buffer).|
|`sc`|`showcmd`|Show the input of an *incomplete* command.|
|`vb`|`visualbell`|Chose "visual bell" effect rather than "beeping".|
|`wmnu`|`wildmenu`|Make use of the "status line" to show possible completions of command line commands, file names, and more.|
|`noeb`|`noerrorbells`|Turn off the bell. You do know the "beep" you get when you type ESC in normal mode?|
|`noet`|`noexandtab`|When inserting text do not expand TABs to spaces. While I try to avoid all control characters in text I can make good use of TABs when typing a table. And I know I can always make Vim expand the TABs later (using the `:retab` command).|
|`nosol`|`nostartofline`|Prevent the cursor from changing the current column when jumping to other lines within the window.|
|`nowrap`|`nowrap`|Turn off automatic wordwrapping.|
|`bs=2`|`backspace`|Backspace with this value allows to use the backspace character (aka CTRL-H or "<-") to use for moving the cursor over automatically inserted indentation and over the start/end of line.|
|`fo=cqrt`|`fold`|This allows one to add text to a comment and still be within the comment after you start a new line. It also allows to break the line within a comment without breaking the comment.|
|`shm=at`|`shortmess`|This shortens about every message to a minimum and thus avoids scrolling within the output of messages and the "press a key" prompt that goes with these.|
|`tw=72`|`textwidth`|This explicitly sets the width of text to 72 characters.|
|`ww=<,>,h,l,[,]`|`whichwrap`|Sets the default cursor behavior when reaching the beginning or end of a line.|
|`com=b:#,:%,n:>`|`command`|Reformat text and preserve comments.|
|`list`|`list`|(coming soon...)|
|`lcs=tab:>-,trail:~,extends:^`|`listchars`|(coming soon...)|
