Farewell Linux, Maybe Someday Soon
==================================

For the past several weeks, I have toyed with the notion of abandoning
Linux entirely. My reasons are as follows:

1.  Linux feels increasingly bloated and broken.
2.  My desktop PC useage has become highly focused over the past several
    months and mostly limited to software development, checking email
    and writing articles.
3.  The World Wide Web is *ugly* and overly complex. Period.

Of course there are many worrysome aspects of dropping Linux entirely.
The most concerning one being the fate of my Github repositories. What
becomes the fate of a perceived "abandoned" project? I have yet to
answer this question and am working to find a happy medium where I can
pursue alternative options while still maintaining a presence on Github.
