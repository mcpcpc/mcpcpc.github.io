# C'ya Later Linux...

For the past several weeks, I have thought about abandoning Linux entirely. My motivation is based on the following principles:

1.  Linux feels increasingly bloated and broken.  
2.  My desktop PC useage has become highly focused over the past several months and limited to (1) software development and (2) writing articles.
3.  The World Wide Web is ugly and overly complicated and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
