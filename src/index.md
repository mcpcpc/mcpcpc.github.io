Hello! My name is Michael Czigler and I create minimally viable solutions written in C.

## xwm

[xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) ("XCB Window Manager") is a tiny floating window manager written using the XCB protocol. The acyronym "xwm" is a homage to the original and now-defunct "X Window Manager". Both projects are unaffiliated and do not share any common source code.

This project differs from other window managers as the focus is entirely on creating a minimally viable solution. This means that mosy users will find that many "regular" features are missing. This sets the expectation that the user be able to provide or patch in the features that they desire.  

* borders with focus/unfocus color params
* focus follows mouse
* POSIX C99 and MISRA-C compliant

## xbg

[xbg](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg) is a tiny background color setter written using the XCB protocol.
