My name is Michael Czigler and I create minimum viable solutions written in C.

## xwm

[xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) ("XCB Window Manager") is a tiny floating 
window manager written using the XCB protocol. This project provides a limited 
set of out-of-box features:

* Parameterized window settings (default sizes, borders, colors, etc.).
* Configurable and extendable key bindings and default utilities (`st`, 
  `dmenu`, `surf`, etc.).
* POSIX C99 and MISRA-C compliant, which  promotes portability, security and 
  safety of the source.


To get started, one can simply use `git` and `make` commands to build and install
`xwm`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm
cd xwm
make
sudo make install
```

## xbg

[xbg](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg) is a tiny background color setter written 
using the XCB protocol. 

To get started, one can simply use `git` and `make` commands to build and install 
`xbg`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg
cd xbg
make
sudo make install
```
