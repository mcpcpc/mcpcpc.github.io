# Creating Mimimum Viable Solutions

My name is Michael Czigler and I create dead-simple programs that contain all
of the core components that have been deemed necessary to be a viable solution.  
Most of my projects are written in the C programming language, which best 
aligns withe the sucess.org and Unix philosophies.

## xwm

[xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) ("XCB Window Manager") is a tiny floating 
window manager written using the XCB protocol. This project provides a limited 
set of out-of-box features, including parametric window settings, configurable 
and extendable key bindings and default utilities, as well as POSIX C99 and 
MISRA-C compliance.

Getting started is a easy as using `git` and `make` commands to build and install
`xwm`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm
cd xwm
make
sudo make install
```

## xbg

[xbg](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg) is a tiny background color setter written 
using the XCB protocol. 

Getting started is a easy as using `git` and `make` commands to build and install
`xbg`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg
cd xbg
make
sudo make install
```
