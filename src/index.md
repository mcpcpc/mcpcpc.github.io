Hello! My name is Michael Czigler and I create minimally viable solutions written 
in C. The following are examples of my more recent projects.

## xwm

[xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) ("XCB Window Manager") is a tiny floating 
window manager written using the XCB protocol. This project is considered a
minimally viable solution and, therefore, provides a limited set of out-of-box
features:

* configurable window paremeters (default size, borders, colors, etc.)
* configurable and extendable key bindings
* configurable and extendable default utilities (beyond st, dmenu, and surf)
* focus follows mouse
* POSIX C99 and MISRA-C compliant, which  promotes portability, security and 
  safety of the source.

This sets the expectation for the the user to expand or patch-in features that
they so desire. For patch examples (and screenshots of xwm in use), refer to the
[xwm-patches](http://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm-patches) repository.


*This project is a homage to the original and now-defunct "X Window Manager". 
Both projects are unaffiliated and do not share any common source code.*

## xbg

[xbg](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg) is a tiny background color setter written 
using the XCB protocol.
