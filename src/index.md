Hello! My name is Michael Czigler and I create minimally viable solutions written 
in C. The following are examples of my more recent projects.

## xwm

[xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) ("XCB Window Manager") is a tiny floating 
window manager written using the XCB protocol. The acyronym "xwm" is a homage 
to the original and now-defunct "X Window Manager". Both projects are 
unaffiliated and do not share any common source code.

Out of the box, the xwm provides a limited set of features:

* borders with focus/unfocus color params
* focus follows mouse
* POSIX C99 and MISRA-C compliant

This project differs from other window managers as the focus is entirely on 
creating a minimally viable solution. This means that mosy users will find that 
many regular features are missing. This sets the expectation for the the user to 
expand or patch-in features that they so desire.

## xbg

[xbg](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xbg) is a tiny background color setter written 
using the XCB protocol.
